## Description

_This repository has been created in order to showcase a programming challenge about looping completed in JavaScript._

## challenge

Given an array of integers, return indexes of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same index twice.

**Sample Input**

```
twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)
```

**Sample Output**

```
[0, 1]
```

**Explanation**


nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9
